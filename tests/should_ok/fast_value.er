Python's `STORE_NAME` was changed incompatibly in CPython 3.10.
`STORE_NAME` was originally an instruction to branch to `STORE_FAST` or `STORE_GLOBAL` depending on the context,
but as of 3.10, it now uses `STORE_GLOBAL` even when the value should clearly be fast.
Currently the Erg code generator has already addressed this issue,
but we added a test to ensure that future changes will not cause the same issue again.

f(x: Int): Int =
    y = x
    if x == 0, do:
        f::return 0
    _ = f x - 1
    y

# if `y` is global, here `f(1)` will return 0
assert f(1) == 1
